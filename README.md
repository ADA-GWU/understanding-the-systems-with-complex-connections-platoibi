For MACOS, you can just run "runner.sh" script -> bash runner.sh


For other OS:
    Step 1. Start 3 servers -> python3 Server.py
    Step 2. Start client -> python3 Client.py


Instructions:
    - type your digit input into the client terminal
    - after that you should see which port (server) the input is sent to and the output will be displayed there
